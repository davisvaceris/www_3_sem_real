                      Sensory cues like temperature, smells and brightness on the outer shell of the server or the server's audio interface can either distract or lull users into a false sense of comfort, according to Jay Rayner, a former restaurant critic and the editor-in-chief of The Observer in London.

"The last thing you want is for your server to look at the time and not tell you when your food is being cooked," he told CNBC.com.

As part of the trend, Samsung and other server manufacturers are beginning to talk about showing a visual representation of the food that cooks in their servers.

"When people are in their seats with their phone in their hand, you're telling them there is a server, but no visual cues," Rayner said.

Samsung is the first company in the world to do so by launching its Aquos R2.

Its launch came a day after it unveiled its S8 flagship phone in a high-profile event at the South Korean firm's global headquarters in Seoul.

Executives said the camera was a key part of its high-end phone, and of its handset in general.

They also noted the presence of artificial intelligence and said Samsung's machines would learn more about people's needs.

"We have made it so much simpler," Samsung's business head for digital systems Kim Hyun-jong said. "It's made for a more human interaction."

But the consumer technology manufacturer is not the first to talk about this sort of thing.

Server-related messages were once rare in servers.

"A restaurant environment is just that; a restaurant," Rayner said.

"Now that they're replacing staff, I'm not convinced how helpful they are. And yes, you can play games on them or watch movies. But they're not going to sit there and entertain you. At least I know I would not."

The Market

The server hardware market is worth an estimated $55 billion globally, according to Gartner.

Milton Research, meanwhile, forecasts a 42 percent decline in overall server shipments in 2017, led by shipments of low-end servers in the services market.

At the same time, its research shows an 86 percent drop in revenues for server vendors serving the cloud.

In response to the decline, vendors will focus on lower pricing and expanding their direct sales networks to reach consumers, said Antonio Morgese, vice president of market operations for server, storage and networking systems at Dell.

"They are trying to build up direct sales for things like storage and networking. They will try to cover all their bases as much as they can," he said.

Despite that, Dell saw its overall server shipments rise 13 percent during its fourth quarter, bolstered by a 26 percent rise in storage and 19 percent in networking.

Rayner said Dell, which tends to favor storage and networking, was leading the overall server market.

He pointed to that and other products, like Nvidia's GPUs, as examples of manufacturers building devices to a range of requirements.
